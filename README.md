# Prework - *Sw1ft*

Submitted by: **Grace Radlund**

**Sw1ft** is an app that displays information about myself. It displays my name, school, aspirations, and a photo of me!
Functionality allows a user to change the color of the background and a bonus feature that lets you add or subtract likes!
It was given this name because it is my first application I wrote in Swift!

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Snapchat

  - Different tools that display different information (ex: map with radar, line graph showing temperature, current temperature big and bold)
3. Calander
  - Add or remove future events
  - Share event details with others
4. LinkedIn
  - Connect with others

  - Have different groups that are easily accessible to switch between

I would like to create a parking application that I can use with my brother. We share a car, so it is sometimes difficult to 
remember where we parked. This app will let us display our spot - this will require some sort of database as we need to store
and retireve data. I will need to have functionality to add, view, and remove a spot.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

I'm not sure how constraints work, but hoping to learn through taking this course!
